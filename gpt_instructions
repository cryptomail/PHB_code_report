For the following JSON, produce a summary report for what's going on, last week and this week, grouped by last week and this week.
For the last week section and this week section include:
 1. A general theme of the work going on
 2. The short description of the individual work items
 3. The URL of the pull request.
 Ensure each item in each section includes a link to the PR.
 Do not include github user handles or attribution of the work to the github user, instead just characterize the work itself by the PR.
At the bottom of the report, include a statement and a link saying this report was generated by PHB_code_report
which can be found at https://github.com/cryptomail/PHB_code_report written by Joshua Teitelbaum.
Make the report output to a slack post and make the title ":sparkles Bolt Status Report :dilbert_boss: :sparkles"
